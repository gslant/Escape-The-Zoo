# Escape The Zoo!
*Escape The Zoo!* is PC-only, competitive shared-screen 2D board game where two players compete to reach the end of the board first and win the game, made using Unity2D. Throughout the board game playthrough, there will be random tiles that will either spawn a competitive minigame, help you to advance in the game, or disadvantage you from winning the game.
This PC game uses mouse clicks, WASD and arrow keys for player input.

## Installation 
To build the project, you must clone this repository and have Unity installed with [version 2021.3.7f1](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases). Ensure you are on the **release** branch. Once the project is open in Unity, at the top left, go to **File > Build Settings**, and ensure the selected Platform is ‘Windows, Mac, Linux’. After that, click **Build** to build the project or **Build And Run** to build the project and immediately open the application once built. Then in the save dialogue, choose the location to save the project into, and then press the **Save** button. 
For further information, please look at the official [Unity guide for building projects](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PublishingBuilds.html).

## Contributing
This project is an open source project, meaning we allow contributers to develop the project further. To contribute to the project, you may **fork** this repository and work on it however you like. If you want to merge your code into the original production code, please create a pull request for the **main** branch and request a reviewer from the authors listed further below. Please make sure your forked repository is updated with the latest production code, as we do not want to deal with a lot of merge conflicts :~).

## Testing
We have used Test-Driven-Development (TDD) to create some of the features in this project. To access the tests, go to the **tests** branch of this repository. We used Unity Test Runner, which can be opened by going to **Windows > General > Test Runner**. After this, go to the **Assets** folder, then go to the **Tests** folder, where the tests will be located. After that, you can ‘Run All’ the test code or select a test to run and ‘Run Selected’.
